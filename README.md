# Genetic neural network

An attempt at making a neural network that is described by chromosomes.

Each round consists of a population of 100 cars controlled by those neural networks. Their fitness is based on how quickly they make it to the finish line.
Best cars are matched and their chromosome crossed over with a chance of mutation. This keeps happening until user decides to stop.
